## Education

**Ph.D. in Mathematics (ongoing)**  
Pontificia Universidad Católica de Chile  
I am a mathematician whose main interests lie in number theory and arithmetic geometry.

My work focuses on the study of arithmetic structures and their relationships with geometry, with particular emphasis on number fields, quaternion algebras, Shimura curves, and abelian varieties.

I am currently a fourth-year Ph.D. student in Mathematics at the Pontificia Universidad Católica de Chile.

Beyond research, I am interested in writing as a way of thinking and organizing ideas.
This site serves both as an academic space and as a personal place to write with freedom and care.
